The National League won 7-6 over the American League in this year's All Star Game thanks to Phillies DH Kyle Schwarber's heroics in the first ever 'swing off' in ASG history. Tied 6-6 after the AL mounted a roaring comeback, Schwarber homered 3 times in 3 swings to clinch victory for the NL, earning him an unprecedented All Star Game MVP award, capping off a thrilling All Star event in Atlanta.

From Cal Raleigh, the league leader in homers, winning the Home Run Derby, Skenes vs Skubal, Kershaw being honored, Pete Alonso's 3 run jack, Corbin Carroll being the first Diamondback to ever homer in the All Star Game, the AL's epic comeback charge, to the first ever swing off to replace extra innings, this  All Star event had it all. And in an era where the other sports can't seem to get it right, with the NBA All Star Game receiving yearly widespread criticism, the NFL Pro Bowl being a lesser viewed event, the NHL only now getting it sort of right with the Four Nations Tournament, only the MLB, and the game of baseball, seems to have stood the test of time.

MLB's formula for the All Star Game hasn't really changed. It's the derby on the Monday followed by the game on the Tuesday. It's simple yet it works. Sure, maybe its because its the only of the 4 major sports to be on during the summer, but at it's core, even for an exhibition game, it has always been competitive, and its biggest stars always rise to the top. 

There's something different about the game of baseball where the best always want to play, and competition is always at an all time high. There isn't really any time to 'take a play off' or to 'just go through the motions' even in an event like the All Star Game, because baseball inherently wasn't meant to be played that way. Sure, a pitcher like Skubal or Skenes can just get on the mound and toss 60 MPH pitches, but that's not what they're known for. They *want* to light up the radar gun, they *want* the swing and miss, they *want* to dominate. 

Players show up to the game and play in a way that's true to them. Whether it's Jacob Misiorowski's fastball at 102, or Kershaw's signature curveball, or Pete Alonso's power, or Steven Kwan's ability to just put balls in play, these players always put max effort on the biggest stage and showcase why the were elected to represent their respective leagues in this tournament. Maybe it's just that baseball's a simple game to its core - a game between the pitcher and the batter, and sticking to that tradition and fielding the league's very best at what they do will always result in a spectacle that has remained, and will always continue to remain, memorable and timeless.
