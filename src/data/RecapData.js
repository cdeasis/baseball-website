It was a little too late as the was the only offense the Braves could muster, as they falter yet again.

Boston with the win climbs back to even at .500, while the Nationals ownership responded quickly after the game by letting go of manager Martinez and GM Rizzo. Certainly an eye-opening move as the Nationals, though being swept, have a strong young core that's still in development. The win for the Red Sox keeps them in the mix in the AL East and in the Wildcard, as the headback home to face league-worst Colorado. Washington on the otherhand will have to answer a lot of questions as they head to St. Louis to faceoff against the Cardinals.",

The reigning AL Central champions, off a campaign that took them to the ALCS are desperately looking for answers, but as the trade deadline approaches the reality of being sellers is becoming evermore so apparent, with big names that can possibly be shipped elsewhere.

The offense of late has started to wake up and show signs, but it has been the pitching that has contributed to their slide, but Max Fried reliable as ever, especially after a loss, showed up big time to end the losing streak. Great defense by Cody Bellinger to stop an extra base hit and to double off Lindor at third was the nail in the coffin in a game the Yankees had to win to keep up with Toronto in the standings. The Pinstripes head back home to play the Mariners, in what should be a thrilling matchup between AL MVP frontrunner Aaron Judge and his closest competitor Cal Raleigh. The Mets have an early 6:35 start as they head down for an interleague matchup with the struggling Orioles.",
